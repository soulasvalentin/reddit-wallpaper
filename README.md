# reddit-wallpaper

This project is a functional application for browsing, downloading, and setting windows background images from popular wallpaper-related subreddits. At the same time, the project is used for testing out new C# features.

## What's next?

At the moment, the project won't be further developed. Bugs will be fixed. The idea is to move all of the logic into GO. Once the new project is started, a link will be added in this file.
